Operating systems have what is called a kernel. The kernel manages all of the hardware of a computer. It also manages basic system programs. These managed programs are used to boot up the OS and configure it.
Another OS function is managing the Main Memory. It keeps track of which bytes of memory are used by which user program. The OS also decides the order in which process are granted access to memory, and for how long.
An OS manages device communication with their respective drivers. It keeps tracks of all devices connected to the system. It also designates a program responsible for every device known as the Input/Output controller.
